## SQLiteStudio Linux aarch64 build

This is the portable build of SQLiteStudio and is intended to be run on Linux Arm64 [UserLand Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.ula).

To build  this I have created a bash script (`build_sqlitestudio_qt5.sh`) that closely follows the Github Action workflow [`lin_release.yml`](https://github.com/pawelsalawa/sqlitestudio/blob/3.4/.github/workflows/lin_release.yml) for the 3.4 branch of SQLiteStudio.
